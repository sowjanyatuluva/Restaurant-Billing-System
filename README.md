# Restaurant-Billing-System
# Prime Restaurant Billing System

This is a Python-based restaurant billing system that generates tax invoices for customers, including non-veg and veg menu options. The program calculates the total, tax, and grand total, and writes the bill details into text files. It also updates the bill number automatically and stores the invoice for record-keeping.

## Features
- Displays a non-veg and veg menu with prices.
- Accepts item orders, calculates total, tax, and grand total.
- Generates a printed invoice with details like date, table number, item names, prices, and quantities.
- Saves the bill to two files: one for the customer (`billslip.txt`) and one for the restaurant's record (`Record.txt`).
- Auto-increments the bill number for every new bill.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-billing-system.git
   cd restaurant-billing-system
2. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
3. Run the Python script:
 python billing_system.py
4. The program will ask for:
